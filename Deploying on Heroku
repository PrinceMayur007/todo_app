Deploying guide:

now, in your virtualenv intall guni corn:
        pip install gunicorn

with gunicorn you can serve your application in multiple threads 

now you will freeze the application, (means it will enlist required packages in file.)
        pip freeze > requirements.txt


After this we will make new file called 'Procfile'. This will use Heroku to deploy the application. 

we will write:
